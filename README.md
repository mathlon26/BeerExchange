# Idea

This is a website for pub owners to host Stock Exchange events. Drinks will be dynamically priced or managed by the host. The host can dump and pump a market and users can follow real time charts on their phone by entering e UID or scanning a QR code.
The project is almost finished but there is no longer active development.
